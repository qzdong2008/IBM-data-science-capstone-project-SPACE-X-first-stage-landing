# Project -- Predict the landing of SpaceX first stage launch 

### This project will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

In this project, we will collect data from various sources by using data collection method, then we will improve quality by performing data wrangling. After data is ready, we can explore the processed data through EDA (exploratory data analysis) and SQL to query the data and gain the insights. Further, data visualization will be applied to obtain more insights. We will build the predictive model through machine learning method for classification. 


After applying this methodologies, we first collect the data for SPACEX first stage launch, then clean the data to get the useful information for Falcon 9 launch. After analyzing the data by SQL and visualization, we find the relation among the flight number, Launch site, Payload mass, Booster version, Booster Version category  and outcome. Finally, we use machine learning method for classification to build tree decision model, the prediction accuracy is around 83.33%.

I will go through the whole cycle of data science starting from (1) data collection methodology: describe how data sets were collected; (2)data wrangling: describe how data were processed;(3)Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and (my)SQL; (4) perform interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash; (5) perform predictive analysis using classification models: how to build, tune, evaluate classification models.
